# -Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
## Overview of the analysis
Pewlett Hackard , a large company with an aging workforce, is looking to acqurie more data to transition their retiring workforce with new employees.   Pewlett Hackard wants to determine the number of retiring employees per title and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program (employees in their late-mid carrer). 
## Results
1. Total Employees Retiring: We identified retiring employees as employees whos birth date was between 1952 and 1955.  This resulted in a total of over 90 thousand employees.

2. Retiring Per Title: We identified 7 key employee titles that have upcoming retirement.  Senior Engineers, Senior Staff, Engineers, and staff presented the majority of 90 thousand employees.  In order to fill the roles into more senior roles will be a massive undertaking.  Luckily there is hope with the mentorship program. 

3. Planning for retirement: We have also identified all the employees and their employee titles that will eventually retire.  This will be usefull to strategize to fill those positions. 


4. Mentorship Program: Employees that have been identified as potential mentors are employees who are in their mid-late career but not near retirement (Born in 1965).  The total mentorees identified are about 1500 employees.

## Summary
As mentioned before, 90 thousand employees are due for retirement, some analysit have called this the "Silver Tsunami".  The mentorship program with 1500 employees could help but diving closer we notice that the title demographics of the mentors did not match up with the retiring demographics, particularly with Senior Engineers, and engineers as shown below. More engineers need to become Senior Engineers.

A further analsis reveals that the demographic for potential mentors is the same from '1962-01-01' to '1965-12-31' but yielded 56 thousand potential mentorees. By tapping into a larger pool of staff engineers and engineers, we can have the desire mentors and mentorees that the buisness needs.
